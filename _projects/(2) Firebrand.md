description: An XCOM-inspired political sim with a strategy map mode and a turn-based tactics encounter mode. Players would build political movements and battle for electoral domination while flirting with totalitarianism and the occult. Play until elections are suspended or the world ends, whichever comes first.

## Firebrand
Firebrand was essentially two games, a strategy map where players dispatched their agents for electoral shenanigans, then a turn-based tactics game whenever opposing agents clashed. It featured two map generators - one for the city map and then another for the turn-based tactics, character creators and generators, and simple AI to play against.

Firebrand received Concept Definition funding from Ontario Creates, and was a finalist at the 2021 Ubisoft Indie series. However, it was dropped due to its large scope and the team becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the gameâ€™s themes in relation to current events.
