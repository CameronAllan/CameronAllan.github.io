Firebrand received Concept Definition funding from Ontario Creates, and was a finalist at the 2021 Ubisoft Indie series. However, it was dropped due to its large scope and the team becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the gameâ€™s themes in relation to current events.

Features:
Procedurally generated city maps with demographics, points of interest, and information levels.
Procedurally generated turn-based tactical maps in the city streets, with generated buildings and other decoration.
