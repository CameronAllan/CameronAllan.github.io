## Firekeep
Firekeep is a minimalist, relaxing strategy game about building a tiny, sustainable city in the cold void of space. Build, combine and upgrade dozens of unique buildings to overcome procedurally-generated islands and keep your fire burning. Firekeep was originally intended to be a much smaller, more puzzle-y project, but it quickly became clear that the fun was in creating efficient little networks like a tiny city-builder.
