# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a self-taught programmer, designer and artist who's been running an indie studio full-time since 2019! In that time I've worn a ton of different hats, and most recently shipped Firekeep into Early Access on Steam! I have a ton of experience solving design problems and implementing them on tight timelines and budgets, and I've had to tackle them from all perspectives - developer, producer and business strategist. 

Before that, I spend 5 years in advertising - first as a strategist, then as a tools developer. I'm a great communicator, and an expert at pitching ideas both internally and externally, along with managing clients, partners and inter-disciplinary teams.

In my spare time I try to get outdoors as much as I can - running, hiking and portaging. I also brew my own (mostly drinkable) beer!
